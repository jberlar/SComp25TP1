1. Ofimática (Office Tasks)
PCMark 10: This benchmark measures overall office productivity including document editing and presentation tasks.
3DMark (Time Spy): While primarily a gaming benchmark, it provides insights into performance with DirectX applications which can be relevant for graphics-heavy office applications.
Microsoft Office Performance (Excel, Word, PowerPoint): Measure tasks like opening documents, data calculations (Excel), rendering presentations (PowerPoint).
2. Streaming
OBS Studio Performance Tests: Measure CPU and GPU utilization while streaming at various resolutions and bitrates.
Handbrake Encoding Benchmark: Test encoding speeds for video files at various resolutions and formats.
Blender (Open Data Benchmarks): Use the rendering section for real-time performance benchmarks in streaming graphics.
3. Programación (Programming)
Geekbench: Evaluate performance with benchmarks for compiling code.
Cinebench: Although focused on 3D rendering, it offers insights into CPU performance under multi-threaded workloads that can be reflective of programming tasks.
VisBench: Specialized benchmarks for measuring performance in various IDE activities.
4. Compilación (Compilation)
OpenSSL (Compilation Test): Compile OpenSSL with various configurations and measure time.
Linux Kernel Compilation: Benchmarks that measure the time taken to compile the Linux kernel, an extensive and complex task.
GCC Compilation Benchmark: Assess the speed of compiling various codebases written in different languages.
5. Videojuegos (Gaming)
3DMark: Offers different tests (like Fire Strike and Time Spy) to benchmark gaming performance.
Frame Rate Benchmarks: Measure frame rates across different titles using software like FRAPS or built-in game performance metrics.
Unity Benchmark: Use Unity's benchmark tool to assess graphics performance in a game development context.
6. Edición de imágenes (Image Editing)
Adobe Photoshop Benchmark: Use scripts to automate tasks in Photoshop, measuring performance for specific tasks like applying filters, rendering, or exporting images.
GIMP Performance Test: Benchmark specific image editing tasks like filtering, resizing, and batch processing.
CorelDRAW Performance: Run a benchmark on vector graphic rendering and manipulation.
General Considerations
Cinebench (CPU based): For rendering tasks relevant for all categories.
Storage Performance Tests: Use tools like CrystalDiskMark or ATTO Disk Benchmark to evaluate how storage speed affects all tasks, especially in I/O-heavy applications.
Cross-application Workflow Tests: Combine tasks from different categories to measure overall system performance in multitasking scenarios.
